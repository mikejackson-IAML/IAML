  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss discrimination challenges you're currently facing and identify which scenarios will have the biggest impact for you. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same practicing attorney instructors, current discrimination law content, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other HR professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block II of the Certificate in Employee Relations Law?", "answer": "Yes. Discrimination Prevention and Defense is Block II of the full Certificate in Employee Relations Law program. You can take it as a standalone 2-day program, or combine it with Comprehensive Labor Relations (Block I) and Special Issues in Employment Law (Block III) to earn the full certificate."},
    {"question": "We're seeing more accommodation requests. Will this help?", "answer": "Absolutely. The program covers ADA essential function analysis, mental health accommodations, PWFA/PUMP intersections, and how to coordinate ADA/FMLA/Workers' Comp without compounding liability. You'll leave with frameworks for handling the most complex accommodation scenarios."},
    {"question": "How current is the discrimination content?", "answer": "Very. The curriculum addresses post-Bostock LGBTQ+ claims, religious accommodation after Groff, reverse-discrimination and DEI backlash, hybrid workplace harassment, and the current OFCCP/affirmative action landscape. Our instructors update content based on cases they're currently handling."},
    {"question": "Does the $1,375 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing employment attorneys, complete program materials, 13 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Employee Relations Law?", "answer": "Yes. Discrimination Prevention and Defense (Block II) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete the remaining blocks—Comprehensive Labor Relations (Block I) and Special Issues in Employment Law (Block III)—at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Employee Relations Law."}
