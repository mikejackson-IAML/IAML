  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss labor relations challenges you're currently facing and identify which scenarios will have the biggest impact for you. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same practicing attorney instructors, current labor relations methodologies, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other HR and LR professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block I of the Certificate in Employee Relations Law?", "answer": "Yes. Comprehensive Labor Relations is Block I of the full Certificate in Employee Relations Law program. You can take it as a standalone 2-day program, or combine it with Discrimination Prevention & Defense (Block II) and Special Issues in Employment Law (Block III) to earn the full certificate."},
    {"question": "I work in a non-union environment. Is this program relevant for me?", "answer": "Absolutely. A significant portion of the program covers union avoidance strategies, recognizing organizing risks, and maintaining compliance in non-union settings. You'll learn how to reduce organizing heat through lawful hiring, onboarding, and supervisor training—critical knowledge even if you've never faced a union campaign."},
    {"question": "How current is the labor relations content?", "answer": "Very. The curriculum addresses the latest NLRB developments including the Cemex decision's impact on elections, Stericycle's effect on handbook policies, and the current joint-employer standard. Our instructors update content based on cases they're currently handling."},
    {"question": "Does the $1,375 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing labor attorneys, complete program materials, 13 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Employee Relations Law?", "answer": "Yes. Comprehensive Labor Relations (Block I) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete the remaining blocks—Discrimination Prevention & Defense (Block II) and Special Issues in Employment Law (Block III)—at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Employee Relations Law."}
