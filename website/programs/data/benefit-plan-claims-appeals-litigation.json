  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss your specific claims challenges and identify which topics will have the biggest impact for your organization. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same practicing benefits attorney instructors, current claims and litigation content, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other benefits professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 1-day program provides 6.5 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions x 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 12.5 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block II of the Certificate in Employee Benefits Law?", "answer": "Yes. Benefit Plan Claims, Appeals & Litigation is Block II of the full Certificate in Employee Benefits Law program. You can take it as a standalone 1-day program, or combine it with Retirement Plans (Block I) and Welfare Benefits Plan Issues (Block III) to earn the full certificate."},
    {"question": "We're facing a benefits lawsuit. Can this program help?", "answer": "Absolutely. The program covers litigation strategy, administrative record building, standards of review, and the procedural advantages plan administrators have in ERISA litigation. The pre-program consultation is the perfect time to share your situation (confidentially) so our team can point you to the most relevant content."},
    {"question": "I handle disability claims. Is this program relevant?", "answer": "Yes. A significant portion covers the heightened standards for disability benefit claims, including the conflict of interest issues that arise when the claim administrator also pays benefits. You'll learn how to structure decisions and build records that survive judicial scrutiny."},
    {"question": "Does the $575 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing ERISA attorneys, complete program materials, 6.5 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Employee Benefits Law?", "answer": "Yes. Benefit Plan Claims, Appeals & Litigation (Block II) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete the remaining blocks—Retirement Plans (Block I) and Welfare Benefits Plan Issues (Block III)—at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Employee Benefits Law."}
