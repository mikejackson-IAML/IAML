  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss investigation challenges you're currently facing and identify which scenarios will have the biggest impact for you. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person, virtual, and on-demand formats?", "answer": "All three formats feature the same practicing attorney instructors, current investigation methodologies, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other HR professionals and investigators. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. On-demand lets you learn at your own pace over 90 days. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19 credits—enough to make a significant dent in your renewal requirements."},
    {"question": "Is this program only for HR professionals, or can in-house counsel attend?", "answer": "Both. HR professionals gain the investigation skills to handle matters appropriately before escalating to legal. In-house counsel learn the practical investigation frameworks that produce legally defensible documentation. Many organizations send both HR and legal team members together—they report better coordination on investigations afterward."},
    {"question": "I've conducted a few investigations already. Is this program too basic for me?", "answer": "No. The program covers everything from foundational concepts to advanced techniques like trauma-informed interviewing, credibility assessment in \"he said/she said\" situations, and investigating AI bias allegations. Even experienced investigators tell us they leave with refined techniques and updated frameworks for 2026 challenges like remote workplace misconduct and digital harassment."},
    {"question": "How current is the investigation content?", "answer": "Very. The 2026 curriculum addresses challenges most organizations are facing right now: remote workplace misconduct, digital harassment and text-based abuse, social media and off-duty conduct investigations, and even how to investigate AI bias allegations in hiring or discipline decisions. Our instructors update content based on cases they're currently handling."},
    {"question": "Will I learn how to write an investigation report?", "answer": "Yes. You'll learn what belongs in findings versus recommendations, how to draft defensible reports that withstand legal scrutiny, and how to communicate outcomes without over-disclosure. You'll see examples of reports that held up in litigation—and ones that didn't."},
    {"question": "Does the $1,575 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing attorneys who conduct high-stakes investigations, complete program materials, 13 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated investigation resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I use this training to solve an investigation I'm dealing with right now?", "answer": "Absolutely. That's exactly what the pre-program consultation is for. Share your current challenge (confidentially) so our team can point you to the most relevant content. Many participants arrive with an active investigation and leave with a clear action plan."},
    {"question": "Will I be ready to conduct investigations immediately after completing this program?", "answer": "Yes. The program is designed for immediate application. You'll leave with investigation planning templates, interview question frameworks, credibility assessment tools, and report writing guides—all ready to use Monday morning."}
