  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss your specific HR legal challenges—whether you're dealing with accommodation requests, termination decisions, or compliance issues. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same practicing attorney instructors, current legal content, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other HR professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block I of the Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership?", "answer": "Yes. HR Law Fundamentals is Block I of the full Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership program. You can take it as a standalone 2-day program, or combine it with Strategic HR Management (Block II) to earn the full certificate and save $575."},
    {"question": "I already have some HR legal knowledge. Is this too basic for me?", "answer": "Probably not. Employment law has changed significantly—post-Groff religious accommodation standards, AI hiring regulations in multiple states, expanded protected characteristics, new FMLA/ADA intersection traps, and hybrid workplace compliance issues. Many experienced HR professionals find that what they learned 3-5 years ago no longer reflects current legal standards. This program updates your legal foundation with 2026 realities."},
    {"question": "How current is the legal content?", "answer": "Very. The curriculum addresses the latest employment law developments including 2026 pay transparency laws, AI hiring regulations (CO, NY, CA, IL), post-Groff religious accommodation standards, hybrid workplace wage-hour issues, and evolving discrimination law. Our instructors update content based on cases they're currently handling."},
    {"question": "Does the $1,375 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing employment attorneys, complete program materials, 13 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership?", "answer": "Yes. HR Law Fundamentals (Block I) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete Strategic HR Management (Block II) at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership."}
