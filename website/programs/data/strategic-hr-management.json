  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss your specific HR strategic challenges—whether you're building a workforce plan, tackling retention issues, or positioning HR for greater influence in your organization. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same senior HR leader instructors, current strategic frameworks, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other HR professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 2.5-day program provides 16.75 SHRM/HRCI credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 22.75 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block II of the Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership?", "answer": "Yes. Strategic HR Management is Block II of the full Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership program. You can take it as a standalone 2.5-day program, or combine it with HR Law Fundamentals (Block I) to earn the full certificate and save $575."},
    {"question": "Do I need legal HR knowledge before taking this program?", "answer": "Not necessarily, but having a solid legal foundation helps. Strategic HR decisions are more effective when you understand the legal boundaries. If you're unsure about your employment law knowledge, consider taking HR Law Fundamentals (Block I) first, or enrolling in the full Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership to get both components."},
    {"question": "Will this help me move from HR generalist to HR business partner or director roles?", "answer": "That's exactly who this program is designed for. You'll learn the strategic frameworks that distinguish business partners from administrative support: workforce planning aligned with business goals, retention strategies that reduce costly turnover, performance systems that drive results, and the metrics executives actually care about. You'll walk away speaking leadership's language, not just HR's."},
    {"question": "How is this different from other HR strategy programs?", "answer": "Most HR strategy programs are theoretical. This one is practical. You'll work through real strategic challenges with senior HR leaders who have built high-performing HR functions. The program culminates in a live case study where you build a simplified HR strategic plan and receive feedback. You leave with frameworks you can implement Monday morning."},
    {"question": "Does the $1,775 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from senior HR leaders and practitioners, complete program materials, 16.75 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership?", "answer": "Yes. Strategic HR Management (Block II) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete HR Law Fundamentals (Block I) at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Strategic HR Leadership."}
