  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What happens after I register?",
      "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss your specific benefits administration challenges and identify which regulatory topics will have the biggest impact for your organization. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I attend individual blocks instead of the full program?",
      "answer": "Yes. While most participants get the best value from the complete 4½-day program, you can register for individual blocks based on your immediate needs. Block I (Retirement Plans Mastery) is $1,375, Block II (Claims, Appeals & Litigation) is $575, and Block III (Health & Welfare Benefits) is $975. The full program at $2,375 saves you $550 versus purchasing all blocks separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between in-person, virtual, and on-demand formats?",
      "answer": "All three formats feature the same practicing ERISA attorney instructors, current regulatory content, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other benefits professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. On-demand lets you learn at your own pace over 90 days. Choose the format that fits your schedule. The quality and content remain identical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?",
      "answer": "The complete program provides 29.75 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 35.75 credits. That's more than most professionals earn in two years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this program for HR professionals or benefits specialists?",
      "answer": "Both. HR generalists gain the ERISA and ACA compliance knowledge to manage benefits without constantly escalating to outside counsel. Benefits specialists and administrators get deeper expertise in fiduciary rules, nondiscrimination testing, and claims litigation. Many organizations also send in-house counsel who advise on benefits matters. The program is designed to be valuable whether you touch benefits daily or manage them as part of a broader HR role."
    },
    {
      "question": "I manage our 401(k) plan but don't handle health benefits. Should I attend the full program?",
      "answer": "Consider your exposure. If you only administer retirement plans, Block I (Retirement Plans Mastery) and Block II (Claims, Appeals & Litigation) cover ERISA fiduciary rules, plan corrections, and benefits litigation defense. However, many 401(k) administrators also get questions about health plan issues, and the full program provides context that helps you understand the complete benefits landscape. The pre-program consultation can help you decide which blocks are essential for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How technical is the content? Do I need a legal background?",
      "answer": "No legal background required. The program is designed for benefits professionals who need practical compliance knowledge, not law school theory. You'll learn how to handle fiduciary obligations, pass nondiscrimination tests, process QDROs, navigate ACA reporting, and defend benefits claims. Our instructors translate complex ERISA regulations into actionable procedures you can implement Monday morning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the $2,375 program fee include everything?",
      "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing ERISA attorneys, complete program materials, 29.75 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated benefits resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."
    },
    {
      "question": "We're facing a DOL audit. Can this program help?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Block I covers IRS and DOL audit triggers, voluntary correction programs (EPCRS and VFCP), and strategies for fixing plan errors before they become disasters. The pre-program consultation is the perfect time to share your audit situation (confidentially) so our team can point you to the most relevant content. Many participants come with active compliance issues and leave with specific action plans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I be ready to handle benefits compliance after completing this program?",
      "answer": "Yes. The program is designed for immediate application. You'll leave with frameworks for fiduciary decision-making, nondiscrimination testing procedures, claims administration protocols, ACA reporting checklists, and audit defense strategies. Whether you're managing a 401(k), administering health benefits, or handling COBRA and FMLA coordination, you'll have the regulatory knowledge to make confident decisions and avoid the mistakes that trigger penalties and litigation."
