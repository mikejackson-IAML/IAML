  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss your specific retirement plan challenges and identify which regulatory topics will have the biggest impact for your organization. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same practicing benefits attorney instructors, current ERISA content, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other benefits professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions x 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block I of the Certificate in Employee Benefits Law?", "answer": "Yes. Retirement Plans is Block I of the full Certificate in Employee Benefits Law program. You can take it as a standalone 2-day program, or combine it with Benefit Plan Claims, Appeals & Litigation (Block II) and Welfare Benefits Plan Issues (Block III) to earn the full certificate."},
    {"question": "I primarily handle 401(k) plans. Is this program relevant?", "answer": "Absolutely. A significant portion of the program covers 401(k)-specific topics including participant loans, salary deferrals, ADP/ACP testing, safe harbor options, and hardship distributions. You'll also learn fiduciary rules and correction programs that apply to all qualified plans."},
    {"question": "We're facing an IRS audit. Can this program help?", "answer": "Yes. The program covers IRS audit triggers, voluntary correction programs (EPCRS), and strategies for fixing plan errors. The pre-program consultation is the perfect time to share your audit situation (confidentially) so our team can point you to the most relevant content."},
    {"question": "Does the $1,375 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing ERISA attorneys, complete program materials, 13 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Employee Benefits Law?", "answer": "Yes. Retirement Plans (Block I) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete the remaining blocks—Benefit Plan Claims, Appeals & Litigation (Block II) and Welfare Benefits Plan Issues (Block III)—at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Employee Benefits Law."}
