  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What happens after I register?",
      "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss the complex employment law challenges you're currently navigating and identify which advanced topics will have the biggest impact for your organization. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between in-person, virtual, and on-demand formats?",
      "answer": "All three formats feature the same practicing attorney instructors, current legal analysis, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other senior HR professionals and in-house counsel. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. On-demand lets you learn at your own pace over 90 days. Choose the format that fits your schedule. The quality and content remain identical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?",
      "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13.75 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19.75 credits. That's more than most professionals earn in a year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to complete the Certificate in Employee Relations Law first?",
      "answer": "No, but it helps. This program assumes you have working knowledge of employment law fundamentals: Title VII, ADA, FMLA, wage and hour basics. If you're an experienced HR professional, in-house counsel, or have been handling employment matters for a few years, you'll be ready for the advanced content. If you're newer to employment law, consider starting with the foundational Certificate in Employee Relations Law."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this different from the Certificate in Employee Relations Law?",
      "answer": "The foundational program teaches you how employment law works. This advanced program focuses on what's changing right now and what's coming next: new administration priorities, recent Supreme Court decisions, AI in employment, reverse discrimination claims, and the strategies experienced practitioners use to navigate complex situations. Think of it as the difference between learning the rules and learning how to win."
    },
    {
      "question": "How current is the content?",
      "answer": "Very. The 2026 curriculum covers the new administration's enforcement priorities, pending Supreme Court cases, post-Bostock developments five years in, AI hiring compliance, reverse discrimination in the post-DEI landscape, cannabis and psychedelics legalization issues, and non-compete rule changes. Our instructors update content based on cases they're currently handling and regulatory shifts they're tracking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this program only for HR professionals, or can in-house counsel attend?",
      "answer": "Both. Senior HR leaders gain the legal sophistication to partner effectively with counsel and make confident decisions on complex matters. In-house attorneys get practical strategies from peers handling the same high-stakes employment issues. Many organizations send HR directors and employment counsel together. They report better alignment on risk assessment and litigation strategy afterward."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the $1,575 program fee include everything?",
      "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing attorneys who handle complex employment litigation, complete program materials, 13.75 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I attend this program every year or every other year?",
      "answer": "Many alumni return on a regular cycle, annually or every other year, because employment law changes that fast. Court decisions create new precedents. Regulations shift with administrations. Workplace challenges evolve. Your alumni pricing ($300 off) makes it practical to maintain cutting-edge expertise throughout your career. The content is updated each cycle, so you're never repeating the same program."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I be ready to handle complex employment matters after completing this program?",
      "answer": "Yes. The program is designed for immediate application to sophisticated situations: high-risk terminations, retaliation defense, DEI program challenges, AI compliance, executive departures, and whistleblower investigations. You'll leave with current legal frameworks, strategic decision-making tools, and the confidence to advise leadership on the complex employment matters that keep organizations out of litigation."
