  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What happens after I register?",
      "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss the specific benefits compliance challenges keeping you up at night and identify which advanced topics will have the biggest impact for your organization. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to complete the Certificate in Employee Benefits Law first?",
      "answer": "No, but it helps. This program assumes you have working knowledge of ERISA fundamentals, retirement plan administration basics, and health plan compliance requirements. If you've been managing benefits for a few years, handling fiduciary responsibilities, or advising on ERISA matters, you're ready for the advanced content. If you're newer to benefits administration, consider starting with the foundational Certificate in Employee Benefits Law."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this different from the Certificate in Employee Benefits Law?",
      "answer": "The foundational program teaches you how benefits law works. This advanced program focuses on what's changing right now and the sophisticated issues that generate DOL audits, fiduciary litigation, and costly penalties: SECURE 2.0/3.0 implementation, plan error correction strategies, excessive fee lawsuit trends, mental health parity compliance, post-Dobbs reproductive health benefits, and cybersecurity obligations. Think of it as the difference between plan administration and plan defense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?",
      "answer": "The 2-day program provides 13 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 19 credits. That's more than most professionals earn in a year."
    },
    {
      "question": "How current is the content?",
      "answer": "Very. The 2026 curriculum covers SECURE 2.0 implementation deadlines, DOL fiduciary rule developments, Hughes v. Northwestern excessive fee litigation fallout, mental health parity NQTL comparative analysis requirements, ACA affordability adjustments, HIPAA cybersecurity obligations, and post-Dobbs reproductive health benefit strategies. Our instructors update content based on audits they're managing and litigation they're defending right now."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this program only for benefits specialists, or can HR generalists and in-house counsel attend?",
      "answer": "All three. Benefits specialists and plan administrators gain advanced compliance and audit defense strategies. HR generalists who oversee benefits as part of a broader role learn how to spot risks before they become problems. In-house counsel get practical frameworks from peers handling ERISA litigation and DOL audits. Many organizations send benefits and legal team members together. They report better coordination on fiduciary decisions and plan governance afterward."
    },
    {
      "question": "We're facing a DOL audit. Can this program help?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The program covers audit triggers, DOL focus areas (late deposits, missing participants, cybersecurity), self-audit procedures to spot issues before regulators do, and negotiation strategies to minimize penalties when violations are found. The pre-program consultation is the perfect time to share your audit situation (confidentially) so our team can point you to the most relevant content."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the $1,575 program fee include everything?",
      "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing ERISA attorneys who defend fiduciary litigation and manage government audits, complete program materials, 13 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated benefits resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging for in-person format."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I attend this program every year or every other year?",
      "answer": "Many alumni return on a regular cycle because benefits law changes that fast. SECURE 2.0 implementation deadlines roll out through 2027. DOL fiduciary rules keep shifting. Mental health parity enforcement is ramping up. Excessive fee litigation continues expanding to new plan types. Your alumni pricing ($300 off) makes it practical to maintain cutting-edge expertise as regulations evolve. The content is updated each cycle, so you're never repeating the same program."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I be ready to handle advanced benefits compliance after completing this program?",
      "answer": "Yes. The program is designed for immediate application to sophisticated situations: plan error corrections using EPCRS and VFCP, fiduciary breach defense, excessive fee litigation responses, mental health parity documentation, ACA audit defense, and cybersecurity incident response. You'll leave with frameworks for fiduciary decision-making, audit preparation checklists, and the confidence to navigate the complex benefits matters that keep senior leaders out of personal liability."
