  "faq": [
    {"question": "What happens after I register?", "answer": "Within minutes, you'll receive an invoice email. Once payment is processed, you can schedule your complimentary pre-program consultation (10-15 minutes) to discuss employment law challenges you're currently facing. Pre-program materials arrive one week before your session starts."},
    {"question": "What's the difference between in-person and virtual formats?", "answer": "Both formats feature the same practicing attorney instructors, current employment law content, and professional credits. In-person provides face-to-face networking with other HR professionals. Virtual delivers the same live instruction via Zoom with full Q&A capability. Choose the format that fits your schedule—the quality and content remain identical."},
    {"question": "What continuing education credits will I earn?", "answer": "The half-day program provides 3.75 SHRM/HRCI/CLE credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to nearly 10 credits."},
    {"question": "Is this the same as Block III of the Certificate in Employee Relations Law?", "answer": "Yes. Special Issues in Employment Law is Block III of the full Certificate in Employee Relations Law program. You can take it as a standalone half-day program, or combine it with Comprehensive Labor Relations (Block I) and Discrimination Prevention & Defense (Block II) to earn the full certificate."},
    {"question": "Why is this program shorter than the other blocks?", "answer": "Special Issues covers advanced topics that build on foundational employment law knowledge. The half-day format delivers concentrated expertise on wage and hour, workplace torts, ADR, privacy, and post-employment restrictions without repeating fundamentals covered elsewhere."},
    {"question": "How current is the content?", "answer": "Very. The curriculum addresses remote/hybrid wage and hour risks, state cannabis laws, CPRA and state privacy regulations, and post-FTC non-compete enforcement. Our instructors update content based on cases they're currently handling."},
    {"question": "Does the $575 program fee include everything?", "answer": "Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from practicing employment attorneys, complete program materials, 3.75 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to updated resources, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel if you choose in-person format."},
    {"question": "Can I apply this toward the full Certificate in Employee Relations Law?", "answer": "Yes. Special Issues in Employment Law (Block III) counts toward the full certificate. You can complete the remaining blocks—Comprehensive Labor Relations (Block I) and Discrimination Prevention & Defense (Block II)—at any future session to earn the complete Certificate in Employee Relations Law."}
