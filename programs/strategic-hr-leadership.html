      Yes. Block I (HR Legal Mastery, $1,375) covers discrimination law, ADA/FMLA, wage-hour compliance, hiring/termination risk—the legal foundation every HR professional needs. Block II (Strategic HR Leadership, $1,575) focuses on workforce planning, retention strategy, performance systems, and positioning HR as a business partner. Most participants take both blocks together ($2,375, saving you $575), but you can register for either block individually based on your immediate needs.

      The Employee Relations Law program focuses exclusively on legal compliance—labor relations, discrimination defense, and employment law risk. This Strategic HR Management program covers the same legal foundations in Block I, then adds Block II on strategic HR capabilities: workforce planning, talent strategy, retention systems, and positioning HR as a business driver rather than just a compliance function. If you want legal expertise plus the strategic frameworks that get HR a seat at the leadership table, this is your program.

      That depends on when you last updated your legal knowledge. Employment law has changed significantly—post-Groff religious accommodation standards, AI hiring regulations in multiple states, expanded protected characteristics, new FMLA/ADA intersection traps, and hybrid workplace compliance issues. Many experienced HR professionals find that what they learned 3-5 years ago no longer reflects current legal standards. Block I updates your legal foundation with 2026 realities before Block II builds your strategic capabilities on that updated foundation.

      That's exactly who this program is designed for. Block I ensures you have bulletproof legal credibility (executives trust HR professionals who prevent problems, not create them). Block II gives you the strategic frameworks that distinguish business partners from administrative support: workforce planning aligned with business goals, retention strategies that reduce costly turnover, performance systems that drive results, and the metrics executives actually care about. You'll walk away speaking leadership's language, not just HR's.

      Yes. Block I (HR Legal Mastery, $1,375) covers discrimination law, ADA/FMLA, wage-hour compliance, hiring/termination risk—the legal foundation every HR professional needs. Block II (Strategic HR Leadership, $1,575) focuses on workforce planning, retention strategy, performance systems, and positioning HR as a business partner. Most participants take both blocks together ($2,375, saving you $575), but you can register for either block individually based on your immediate needs.

      The Employee Relations Law program focuses exclusively on legal compliance—labor relations, discrimination defense, and employment law risk. This Strategic HR Management program covers the same legal foundations in Block I, then adds Block II on strategic HR capabilities: workforce planning, talent strategy, retention systems, and positioning HR as a business driver rather than just a compliance function. If you want legal expertise plus the strategic frameworks that get HR a seat at the leadership table, this is your program.

      That depends on when you last updated your legal knowledge. Employment law has changed significantly—post-Groff religious accommodation standards, AI hiring regulations in multiple states, expanded protected characteristics, new FMLA/ADA intersection traps, and hybrid workplace compliance issues. Many experienced HR professionals find that what they learned 3-5 years ago no longer reflects current legal standards. Block I updates your legal foundation with 2026 realities before Block II builds your strategic capabilities on that updated foundation.

      That's exactly who this program is designed for. Block I ensures you have bulletproof legal credibility (executives trust HR professionals who prevent problems, not create them). Block II gives you the strategic frameworks that distinguish business partners from administrative support: workforce planning aligned with business goals, retention strategies that reduce costly turnover, performance systems that drive results, and the metrics executives actually care about. You'll walk away speaking leadership's language, not just HR's.

      The complete program provides 29.75 SHRM/HRCI credits. Plus, your enrollment includes 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions × 1.5 credits each = 6 additional credits), bringing your total to 35.75 credits—typically more than HR professionals earn in two years. Block I alone provides approximately 16 credits; Block II provides approximately 13.75 credits.

      Your materials are living resources that update continuously as employment law and HR practices evolve. Recent updates include 2026 pay transparency laws across multiple states, AI hiring regulations (CO, NY, CA, IL), post-COVID workforce engagement strategies, remote/hybrid performance management systems, skills-based hiring frameworks, and the shift from traditional succession planning to dynamic talent mobility models. Unlike static textbooks that become outdated immediately, your resources reflect current legal requirements and strategic HR best practices.

      Every program enrollment includes FREE access to all four quarterly 90-minute update sessions for 12 months (valued at $1,588). These instructor-led sessions cover new regulations, court decisions, and strategic HR trends—delivered mid-January, April, July, and October. Each session is recorded and available within 24 hours. After your first year, you can continue receiving updates at alumni pricing. This keeps you current on both legal compliance AND evolving HR strategies as the workplace continues to change.

      Yes. Your enrollment includes all live instruction from both practicing attorneys (Block I) and senior HR leaders (Block II), complete program materials, 29.75 continuing education credits, pre-program consultation, 12 months of quarterly employment law updates (4 sessions, $1,588 value), permanent access to living resources that update continuously, and alumni benefits for all future programs. The only additional cost would be travel and lodging if you choose in-person format. There are no hidden fees or additional charges.
